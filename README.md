# Project Summary

> <i>Modeled after [Ro](https://ro.co/weight-loss/), a modern direct-to-patient healthcare company</i>

Established in 2016, Row Health is a cutting-edge insurance company that serves over 100,000 customers across the United States.

In 2019, they introduced the Wellness Reimbursement program. This initiative offers subsidies for various wellness products, such as probiotics, digestive enzymes, and stress relief aids, aiming to foster a holistic health approach among their customers.

In this project, I take on the role of a data analyst within the patient research team, whose priority is to understand the performance of this reimbursement program to answer ad-hoc questions and surface recommendations to the product and marketing teams towards their goals of acquiring customers and increasing brand awareness.

This project consists of four parts:
- <b>Part 1: Targeted Insights</b>
  * Using SQL, I offer up answers to questions from the claims department on things like the top hair-related products, states with the most claims, and the most frequent users of our reimbursement program.
 
- <b>Part 2: Marketing Analysis</b>
  * Leveraging Excel, I assess campaign performance for our marketing team focusing on customer acqusition and brand awareness. 

- <b>Part 3: FILL THIS IN</b>
  * ? 

- <b>Part 4: Recommendations & Next Steps</b>
  * Suggestions on things to take a look at going forward.

The data I'll be using is spread out across three tables and consists of information on customers, campaigns, and claims.

Here is the Entity Relationship Diagram for the data I'll be using:
