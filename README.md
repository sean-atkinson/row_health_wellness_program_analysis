# Project Summary

> <i>Modeled after [Ro](https://ro.co/weight-loss/), a modern direct-to-patient healthcare company</i>

Established in 2016, Row Health is a cutting-edge insurance company that serves over 100,000 customers across the United States.

In 2019, they introduced the Wellness Reimbursement program. This initiative offers subsidies for various wellness products, such as probiotics, digestive enzymes, and stress relief aids, aiming to foster a holistic health approach among their customers.

In this project, I take on the role of a data analyst within the patient research team, whose priority is to understand the performance of this reimbursement program to answer ad-hoc questions and surface recommendations to the product and marketing teams towards their goals of acquiring customers and increasing brand awareness.

This project consists of four parts:
- <b>Part 1: Targeted Insights</b>
  * Using SQL, I offer up answers to questions from the claims department on things like the top hair-related products, states with the most claims, and the most frequent users of our reimbursement program.
 
- <b>Part 2: Marketing Analysis</b>
  * Leveraging Excel, I assess campaign performance for our marketing team, focusing on customer acquisition and brand awareness, by selecting three metrics of interest for each.

- <b>Part 3: Recommendations & Next Steps</b>
  * Suggestions on things to take a look at going forward.

The data I'll be using is spread out across three tables and consists of information on customers, campaigns, and claims.

Here is the Entity Relationship Diagram for the data I'll be using:

# Part 1: Targeted Insights (SQL)
[(Back to table of contents)](#table_of_contents)<br><br>

<b>SUMMARY:</b>

<b>2020 Product claims</b>
- Hair Growth Supplements (347 claims per month) and Vitamin B+ Advanced Complex (249 claims per month) were our most claimed products.
- Interestingly, while Hair Growth Supplements saw a steady rise throughout the year, Vitamin B+ Advanced Complex claims peaked in the spring.

<b>Top hair products for June 2023 </b>
- Hair Vitamins Trio ($18K) and Hair Growth Supplements ($12K) had highest claim amounts.
- All other hair products didn't break the $1k mark. This mimics the pattern for the year where Hair Vitamins Trio ($110k) and Hair Growth Supplements ($90k) are our top performers while Hair and Nail Wellbeing ($3.5K) and Hair Vitamins II ($459) lag behind by quite some distance.

<b>Claims and claim amounts by state in 2023</b>
- NJ has the most claims (3,964) and has claimed the highest amount ($479K).
- NJ has led both categories for every year on record.

<b>Total customers with a platinum plan, and who signed up in 2023, or customers who signed up in 2022</b>
- 2,926.
- Unfortunately, only 3 of that 2,926 are platinum members who signed up in 2023.

<b>Customers with the most claims across all time (and total claims)</b>
- Eduardo Johnson (55)
- Marylee Rivera (55)
- Anthony Ford (54)
- Samuel Blount (54)
- Mark Cotton (54)
- Earl Healy (53)
- Charles Black (52)
- Robert Torres (52)
- Catherine Obrecht (52)

<b>Overall average number of days between claims for customer with more than one claim</b>
- 258 days.

<b>The product most often bought as a second product for customers with more than one order</b>
- Vitamin B+ Advanced Complex (3,822 times).
- In terms of second purchases, Vitamin B+ Advanced Complex has outsold the #2 (Hair Growth Supplements) and #3(Detox + Debloat Vitamin) products on the list combined (3,822 vs 3,661).

<b>Technical Analysis:</b><br>
For this analysis, I used SQL and BigQuery. In regards to SQL, I used aggregation functions, window functions, joins, filtering, common table expressions (CTEs), and the QUALIFY clause to use row_number() to filter results.

You can find my SQL queries for the above and other insights [here](https://github.com/sean-atkinson/row_health_wellness_program_analysis/blob/main/sql/claims_department_queries.sql).

Here is an example of me using the QUALIFY clause:
```sql
-- identifying the most commonly ordered 2nd product for customers who have made more than one claim
-- cte to filter customers with more than one claim
WITH customers_multiple_orders AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM `psychic-raceway-393323.rowhealth.claims` claims
  LEFT JOIN `psychic-raceway-393323.rowhealth.customers` customers
   ON claims.customer_id = customers.customer_id 
  QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY claims.customer_id ORDER BY claim_date) = 2
  ORDER BY 1
)

-- main query to calculate the number of claims for each product name 
SELECT product_name, 
  COUNT(DISTINCT claim_id) AS num_claims
FROM customers_multiple_orders
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;;
```

And here is the query result:

# Part 2: Marketing Analysis (Excel)
[(Back to table of contents)](#table_of_contents)<br><br>

<b>SUMMARY:</b>


<b>CUSTOMER ACQUISITION</b>

<b>Signup rates (ratio of signups to impressions)</b>
- Health For All  is the best performing campaign category with a 2.08% signup rate. This is largely due to our Email efforts which by themselves have a signup rate of 3.72%. 
- There's a considerable variation in signup rates across different categories. While Health For All has the highest signup rate at 2.08%, Golden Years Security has the lowest signup rate at a mere 0.001%.
- Social media is been our best performing platform with a 0.23% signup rate, Email follows closely at 0.20%.

<b>Cost per signup (ratio of cost to signups)</b>
- #CoverMatters is the campaign category with the lowest cost per signup ($0.65). Health for All ($1.23) is second. Golden Years Security has the highest cost per signup at $176.73.
- Social Media ($2.25) and Email ($4.04) are our best platforms. TV is by far our worse, with a cost per signup that was 366% higher than social mediaâ€™s.

<b>Signups by channel (new users per platform)</b>
- Social media, with 7,610 signups, brought in 85% more than Email, which was the second most.
- TV is the platform with the least number of total signups, only managing to bring in 494 signups. This, coupled with its high cost per signup ($10.48) and low signup rate (0.08%), suggests that TV is the least effective platform for customer acquisition.<br> 

<b>BRAND AWARENESS</b>

<b>Click-through-rate (ratio of click to impressions)</b>
- In terms of platforms, Email performs the best with a 16.71% click-through-rate (CTR), 94% higher than the next closest platform (Social Media at 8.62%). TV has a 0% CTR.
- The Family Coverage Plan category has a CTR of 0%, indicating no clicks, despite 1.1M impressions. This is something that needs to be looked into further.

<b>Impressions (total times an ad is viewed)</b>
- Tailored Health Plans, #HealthyLiving, Preventive Care News and Family Coverage Plan are the only campaign categories to surpass 1M impressions.
- Health for All has the lowest total impressions of any campaign category (170K), yet has only 182 fewer signups than our best performing campaign category.
- Social Media and SEO have been our best channels for impression at 3.3M AND 3.2M respectively. TV lags behind everyone with 600K.

<b>Cost-per-click (ratio of cost to clicks)</b>
- For campaigns that have recorded at least one click, email is our best platform with a cost-per-click (CPC) of $0.05, social media is next at $0.06.
- SEO and TV are our worse. SEO has a CPC of $0.09. TV has not recorded a single click. 

<b>Technical Analysis:</b>

For this section, I used SQL and BigQuery to create a marketing campaign dataset. 

As part of the data preparation, I created derived columns for metrics that didn't pre-exist within the data (num_signups, signup_rate, cost_per_signup, click_through_rate, and cost per-click). 

In Excel, I used calculated fields because of an issue with non-weighted metrics. Additionally, I utilized Pivot Tables, conditional formatting and statistical analysis to analyze and summarize my insights for the marketing team. 

Here is an example of the pivot table used for customer acquisition insights:

# Part 3: Recommendations & Next Steps
[(Back to table of contents)](#table_of_contents)<br><br>
- <b>Prioritize High-Performing Campaigns and Platforms:</b> Given the strong performance of the 'Health For All' campaign and email marketing efforts, consider increasing the budget for these initiatives by 15-20% (a percentage high enough to see results, but low enough in terms of spend, $3.3K on the high end to be sufficiently cautious). Keep monitoring KPIs to ensure they campaigns continue to have strong ROI.
- <b>Think About Leveraging Social Media for Customer Acquisition and Brand Awareness:</b> Social media has demonstrated strong performance in several metrics.  That being said, [weâ€™re in tumultuous time when it come to social media marketing](https://econsultancy.com/social-media-advertising-2023-trends-predictions/?ssp=1&setlang=en-CA&safesearch=moderate). Perhaps caution is the better part of valour here. It might be best to experiment with increasing social media budget by 10% for the next quarter while closely monitoring customer acquisition and brand awareness metrics.
- <b>Re-evaluate Low-Performing Strategies:</b> TV has shown poor performance on every metric examined. Reduce its budget by 25% next quarter. Reallocate those resources to high-performing channels Email and Social Media. While itâ€™s a significant decrease, itâ€™s not the complete abandonment of this channel. We can re-evaluate at the end of the quarter.
- <b>Expand Email Marketing for Engagement:</b> Experiment with A/B testing by sending half of the target group 15-20% more emails for 30 days (a modest increase but enough to produce a noticeable result if there is an impact). Compare customer acquisition and brand awareness metrics at the end of the test.
- <b>Get to the Bottom of Whatâ€™s Going with the Family Coverage Plan Category:</b> It defies all logic that it can have over 1m impressions and not a single click. I strongly suspect thereâ€™s something wrong with the event tracking for this category. Have our developers take a closer look at it.

# Addendum: Notes on the Marketing Campaign Analysis
[(Back to table of contents)](#table_of_contents)<br><br>
With regards to the marketing campaign analysis, please note that the 24 most recent campaigns have incomplete data. They're currently missing total signups, signup rate, and cost per signup. Consequently, that means only 33 of the 57 campaigns have complete data. Given that the missing data did not prevent meaningful analysis due to the availability of complete records for over half of the campaigns, I proceeded with the data available. However, I kept the potential bias in mind during my analysis and acknowledge my insights and recommendations may have been skewed as a result.
