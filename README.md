# Project Summary

> <i>Modeled after [Ro](https://ro.co/weight-loss/), a modern direct-to-patient healthcare company</i>

Established in 2016, Row Health is a cutting-edge insurance company that serves over 100,000 customers across the United States.

In 2019, they introduced the Wellness Reimbursement program. This initiative offers subsidies for various wellness products, such as probiotics, digestive enzymes, and stress relief aids, aiming to foster a holistic health approach among their customers.

In this project, I take on the role of a data analyst within the patient research team, whose priority is to understand the performance of this reimbursement program and surface recommendations to the product and marketing teams as well as answer ad-hoc questions.

Here is the Entity Relationship Diagram for the data I'll be using:
